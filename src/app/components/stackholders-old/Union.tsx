          Union Digital Centers (UDCs) play a vital role in extending Ami
          Probashiâ€™s services to rural and remote areas. These centers assist
          individuals with BMET registration, biometric data collection, and
          emigration clearance application processes. UDCs also provide access
          to the Ami Probashi platform, helping users enroll in training
          programs and apply for verified job opportunities.
